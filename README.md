# Basic-Web-Scraping-with-Python-
I scraped the data from my college website to find the average height of volleyball players. 
I used the span tag to get the data out of HTML and then created a list of all scraped volleyball players heights.
Web Scraping was done using BeautifulSoup Python library.
